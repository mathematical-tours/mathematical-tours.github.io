%
% Package:  maple2e 
%
% This package defines the latex macros used by "Export to LaTeX" 
% It makes use of several sub-packages.
% 
% mapleenv - Maple Environments used to mark mapleinput, mapleoutput,
% mapletab - Maple Macros to display tables (spreadsheets)
% mapleplots - Maple macros to display plots.
%
% See the comments in maplenv.sty for a more detailed discussion of
% the special environments such as
%
%	\begin{mapleinput} ... \end{mapleinput}
%	\begin{maplelatex} ... \end{maplelatex}
%
% and for details about macros such as
%
%	\mapleinline <status> <type> <verbatim code> <latex code>
%	\maplemultiline{ ... }
%
% which are used to control style and to embed raw Maple data.
% 
% USAGE:
%
%	To use this package, add the line  
%
%	\usepackage{maple2e} to 
%
%	your document preamble.  If you are using a specific plot
%	driver such as dvipsone, then add its name as an option as
%	in:
%
%	\usepackage[dvipsone]{maple2e}
%
%	The default option value is "dvips".
%
%	If you wish to preview your document, ignoring plots, use
%	the "noplots" option.
%
%	The only options available are precisely those needed to
%	control plotting.  Plots are handled by the standard LaTeX2e
%	graphics package and for LaTeX are restricted to postscript.
%	 
% NOTES:
%
%	It is an easy extension of this code to other plot file formats.
%	All that is needed is a new definition of \mapleplot
%	to invoke the graphics code of your choice.
%
%	To adjust the spacing around the Maple environemnts, edit
% 	change the entries in the file mapleenv.def

% Standard Maple Environments
%
% Environments for Export to LaTeX
%
% This package defines the environments used by Maple's
% "Export to Latex" facility.  In addition, each of the environments 
% accepts an optional parameter.  For example, for example,
% Maple Input lines accept any of:
%
%      \begin{mapleinput}...\end{mapleinput},   (default)
%
% The contents of such an environment are in terms of mapleinline.
%
% The "Export to LaTeX" facility of the Maple worksheet does not use any
% of the optional parameters.  They exist to provide the additional
% control needed for reprocessing long LaTeX manuscripts and which is
% carried out by a special "Maple Filter".
% 
% Maple output can occur in several forms.  Maple's "prettyprint" output,
% as well as error messages and warnings, is encapsulated as
%
% 	        \begin{maplettyout}...\end{maplettyout} 
%
% "Export to Latex" generates LaTeX code for the entire worksheet. 
%  The displayed mathematics output is controlled to fit a
%  user specified line width and appears inside the environment
%
% 	\begin{maplelatex}...\end{maplelatex}
%
% Maple generated plots are exported as postscript files.
% The resulting files are included in the LaTeX document 
% by using the macro call
%
%  	\mapleplot{filename}
%
% On processing by LaTeX, the postscript code from the 
% indicated file is read into "dvi" file and a display is 
% generated at that point in the document.  The plot dimensions 
% are specified as \MaplePlotHeight and \MaplePlotWidth.
%
% The actual embedding is accomplished using the LaTeX2e graphics 
% package.  This style file has been tested with the following dvi to 
% PostScript conversion programs:
%
%     dvips 
%     dvipsone
%
% ----------------------------------------------
% Environments that ignored by the Maple Filter
% ----------------------------------------------
% The Maple Filter is a special version of Maple that can read
% and update latex files which have been developed using these
% macros.  There is a need, in such tex files, to display information
% in the same manner as the preceding manner and yet guarantee that
% the information is not changed by the Maple Filter.
% The macros are identical to those describe above, but with each 
% name preceded by an "i".
%
%   \begin{imapleinput}...\end{imapleinput}  like mapleinput
%   \begin{mapleinput}[p]...\end{imapleinput} as above, default case
%   \begin{imaplelatex}...\end{imaplelatex} like maplelatex
%   \imapleplot{filename}   like mapleplot
%   \imaplesepline	  like \maplesepline, but ignored by the filter.
%
% ----------------------------------------------
% Implementation Details
% ----------------------------------------------
% The mapleinput, and maplettyout environments are similar to 
% \begin{verbatim}...\end{verbatim} but with several 
% important differences.
%
% - The spacing relative to the surrounding environment is different.
%
% - Page breaks are encouraged before commands, or after results,
%   and discouraged inbetween.
%
% - maplettyout and maplelatex environments are assumed to follow
%   mapleinput regions and so have less space above.  This allows us to
%   reduce the space between adjacent Maple regions without any
%   elaborate mechanism to detect when there have been intervening
%   paragraphs of text.
%
% - the size of the font for text regions is definable.  Use \MapleFont
%   to reset the font.
%
% - the  indentation of the environments can be indented by setting 
%   the value of \LeftMapleSkip  .
%
% - a prompt is automatically generated at the start of each line in
%   the case of the input environments.
%
% Much of the spacing and sizing information is parameterized.
% The following Macros control most of the spacing for the 
% Maple environments.  They are all resettable in the preamble of 
% your document. 
% 
% \AboveMapleSkip	- space above an environment
% \BelowMapleSkip	- space below an environment
% \AboveMaplePlot	- space above a Maple Plot 
% \BelowMaplePlot	- space below a Maple Plot
% \MaplePlotHeight	- vertical space reserved for a plot
% \MaplePlotWidth	- width reserved for a plot
% \MaplePlotAngle	- angle of rotatation
% \LeftMapleSkip 	- the amount of left indentation
% \MapleFont 		- The Maple font 
% \MapleSize 		- The size of the Maple font in mapleinput and 
%                          maplettyout
% \MapleLatexSize	- The size of the Maple fonts in maplelatex
% \MapleFirstLine	- controls ingoring first line feed
% \MaplePrompttrue 	- controls insertion of prompt char
% \MaplePromptString	- defines the prompt string
% \MaplePromptSecondary	- defines the secondary prompt string
% \MapleSkip		- amount of glue before and after
%			displayed text
% \MapleTab		- number of spaces per tab (8)
%
% Spacing, dimensions, etc.  
%
% These are all defined and given default values in the file
% mapleenv.def Most may be changed in your document preamble.
